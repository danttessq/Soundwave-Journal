  <h2>What Are Music Genres?</h2>
      <p>Music genres are like musical families — they group songs by shared sounds,
        styles, and emotions. From energetic rock to relaxing classical,
        each genre offers a unique experience.
        Genres started to form when musicians and listeners began recognizing patterns in rhythms,
        instruments, and themes. Over time, artists experimented and blended styles, creating new genres and subgenres.
        No one person "invented" music genres — they evolved naturally as music spread across cultures and generations.
        Whether you're into hip-hop, jazz, or electronic beats, there's always a genre that speaks your language.</p>

  <h2>Discovering Music Through Genres</h2>
      <p>Music is a universal language, but genres help us understand its many voices.
        Each genre reflects a different mood, culture,
        and story — from the roots of blues and classical traditions to the modern vibes of pop,
        electronic, and hip-hop. Exploring genres not only helps us find what we love,
        but also opens the door to new sounds from around the world. Whether you’re dancing,
        relaxing, studying, or dreaming — there’s a genre for every moment.</p>
